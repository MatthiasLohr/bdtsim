# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you very much for you interest in contributing in this project!


## Set up the development environment

  * Clone the project (or even better: fork it on GitLab and clone your fork) to your local file system and `cd` into it
  * Set up a python virtual environment and install the package in editable mode:
    ```
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    pip install -e .
    ```
   * For every time you start developing or you open a new shell, load the virtual python environment:
     ```bash
     . ./venv/bin/activate
     ```

That's it! Happy coding!
